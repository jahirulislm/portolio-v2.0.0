# This is my Title

This is a paragraph. You can use **bold text**, *italics*, or [links](https://google.com).

### Subheading
- List item 1
- List item 2

```javascript
// You can even add code blocks!
console.log("Hello TUI World!");




### Quick Guide to Frontmatter Fields:
*   **`title`**: Appears as the main heading.
*   **`date`**: Used to sort posts (newest first). Use `YYYY-MM-DD`.
*   **`excerpt`**: A 1-2 sentence teaser for the home page.
*   **`tags`**: A list of categories like `["Tech", "Go"]`.
*   **`image`**: A link to an image. You can use any image URL or free photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

### Pro Tip for the TUI Theme
Since we are using a **Terminal** theme, your blog posts will automatically look like they are being read in a text editor like `vim` or `nano`! All your headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) and code blocks will be styled with glowing green or cyan colors automatically.
